# Heart-Cleveland-Dataset-Seperated
Heart Cleveland Dataset Seperated by fact/symptoms and ECG data

heart1.csv\
The first part is the factual or symptomatic data such as:\
age: The person’s age in years\
sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\
cp: chest pain type\
    — Value 0: asymptomatic\
    — Value 1: atypical angina\
    — Value 2: non-anginal pain\
    — Value 3: typical angina\
chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\
fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\
exng: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\
thall: A blood disorder called thalassemia \
    Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously\
    Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)\
    Value 2: normal blood flow\
    Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)\


heart2.csv\
The second part of the dataset is the data that has been measured from sensors and ECG devices:\
trtbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\
    — Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria\
    — Value 1: normal\
    — Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\
thalachh:  The person’s maximum heart rate achieved\
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\
slp: slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping\
